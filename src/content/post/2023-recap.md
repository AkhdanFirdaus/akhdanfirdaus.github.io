2023 starts with optimistic start, I celebrated it in National Monument of Jakarta during my internship period by exploring Jakarta's night as a symbol we dare to exploring something new.

This year I found new family, person I consider as parent, brother, sister even though we only spent a short time together. I just can't thanks enough for them. Meet exceptional people, the kindness, unique, true friends, are affecting my perspective and paradigm of the way I see, interacting, and appreciate people.

This year I learn to know myself. Spending time for my own, is the best thing happened and the best way to heal myself. Unlocking new skills and financial management is good. Seeing other people achievement are best booster for motivate myself. New habbit like doing fitness, wake up in the morning, sleep enough, gave myself more time to rest are good investment. Watching movies or series, waiting for an episode every week and maybe wait for another year are worth to wait. And start writing is good to clear my mind eventhought the draft not finished yet.

Separate with partner is very hard to take, but life's goes on. Fall in love with someone new is not going to make it better. The journey still long to find my own true love, I have to be more patience and do the best to add value for myself.

Regret for not taking chances when it is available, but past is in the past. Create my own opportunity, believing so much in myself is the best I can do. This year I believe and prove I can fulfill my duty to finish my study. People might know only the results, but I am the only one who know how hard and tiring the process behind it.

Learning that even you have much time together, sometimes people forget or ignore you. Don't ever thought by helping them they will pay you back and give you the same effort as feedback, that's the most mistake I've take. But, how people treat you is not a mirror of your worth or what You deserve, don't stop being kind to everyone, they deserve treated better. And don't forget to appreciate yourself, you have do the best.

I wrote this in my bed in my own home in the end of the year just to remind me. 2023 ends with much disappointment, yet full of hope. Lot to learn, lot of happiness I can't say thanks enough to they're who accompanied during this heavy journey.

> Even when you feel empty, feel it's the worst time of your life, you're gonna make it. No one is sent by accident to anyone, it's all written.

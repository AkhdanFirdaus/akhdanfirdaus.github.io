## Backstory
Honestly I love to write. But I only write diary, sometimes on app notes or on my little notebook I always brought all the time. I write only the important thing that happen to me on that day, sometimes only write the headline or even full story of best or worst occurance that happened to me. There is one quote that motivates me to write, it is...
> My favorite text is the one that makes me smile every time I read it.

This writing things became habbit on my second year at vocational highschool. My mentor always told us to bring notebook to write trouble-maker student's undisciplined behaviour. That's very exciting to see all of my friends always brought notebook, to see which one has the most line, and which one has the ugliest handwritten. And I take the advantage to write more and more about that, cause everyone admit that I'm very good at concluding everything and documented it in my writing. TBH that's the very fun, hard, and exciting moments that build my character.

But then that habbit is gone far away, many things happened between my vocational highschool til I graduate from college. I start to remember my old resolution soem weeks ago. I really want to write something but I don't know where and how should I write it, so I chose blog! Apart from feeling very personal, it can also add to my portfolio.

## Content Planning
Maybe there will be some genres I want to publish in this personal website. There are:
1. Memorable story.
2. New Knowledge I just learned.
3. Movie and Serial Reviews.
4. Project and Experience I've involved in.
5. Recent activities.

## Challenges
1. Consistency
2. Ideas
